# What is Machine Learning?
-> Machine Learning is defined as field of study that gives computer the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
-> Machine Learning is a subset of AI,that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns
of datsets used to make predictions on new similar type data, without being explicitly programmed
for each task.
-> The ML is defined as A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and perform at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with E.

# Types of Machine Learning.
->  1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    3. Reinforcement Learning

    ## Supervised Learning -> with labelled data(both input and output)
      Types of Supervised Learning -> Classification and Regression.
      Regression for continuous variable.
      Classification for categorical variable. (discrete class)

    ## Unsupervised Learning -> no labelled data(used for hidden pattern and trends)
      Types of Unsupervised Learning -> Clustering and Association.
      Clustering mean grouping of similar datapoints.
      Association identifies relationships or patterns between variables in a dataset.

    ## Reinforcement Learning -> feedback system, get reward for right answer and get penalty for wrong anwser.

# Basic Terminologies:
-> Data Analysis
-> Data Science
-> Data Visualization
-> Deep Learning
-> Neural Networks (basics)
-> AI
-> Embedded Systems
-> Robotics
